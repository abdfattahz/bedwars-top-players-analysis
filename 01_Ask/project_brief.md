# Project Idea - BedWars Top Players

## Why this project?

- I play BedWars and I actually want to **get good at it**, not just play casually.
- Instead of only guessing what “good players” do, I want to look at real data from top players.
- I also want a “real” data project to practice:
  - pulling data from an API,
  - cleaning it in Sheets/Excel,
  - and analyzing it in SQL.

## What I think this project will be

- Take stats from a BedWars server (Pika Network).
- Focus on **top leaderboard players** (not every player on the server).
- Build a small dataset with things like:
  - wins, losses, win rate
  - kills, deaths, K/D
  - final kills, final deaths, FKDR
  - bow stats (hits, shots, accuracy)
  - maybe beds broken, etc.
- Use SQL + some visuals to look for patterns.

## Goals

- End up with a clean table of top players + their main stats.
- Find a few interesting patterns or “playstyles” among the best players.
- Be able to explain the project clearly as a case study in my portfolio.

## Out of scope for now

- Time-series / “over time” analysis.
- Building a full dashboard website.
- Trying to be 100% statistically perfect.
