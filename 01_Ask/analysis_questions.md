# Guiding Questions (Draft)

These are the questions I *think* I want to answer.  
They might change once I see the actual data.

## Main question

- What kind of stats and playstyles do top BedWars players on Pika Network have?

## More specific questions (rough)

- How do the very top players compare on:
  - win rate,
  - K/D,
  - FKDR?

- Does **bow accuracy** actually matter a lot, or are most top players mainly melee-focused?

- Do different “types” of players show up, for example:
  - melee-heavy,
  - bow-heavy,
  - people who get lots of void kills?

- Are there any surprising outliers (for example, someone with crazy FKDR but not many games played)?

## Personal goals

- Practice turning vague questions (“what makes a good player?”) into measurable metrics.
- Practice writing SQL queries that match these questions.
- See if I can turn the findings into simple advice a normal player could try.
